# Fun component

This component is meant just for testing and provides everything you need to
run `fortune | cowsay | lolcat`.

## `fortune`

`forune` prints random text from its dictionary. It can be a quote, a poem, a
joke or enything else

## `cowsat`

`cowsay` accept text and prints a cow which says that text. By the way you can
choose animal from provided list or even make your own.

## `lolcat`

`lolcat` is just like `cat`. But it makes text _rainbow_!
